# Fragile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by letting other people do it and telling them how it's done. Through this work we have come to micromanage:

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
**Working software** over comprehensive documentation
**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
**Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is more micromanagement in the items on
the right, we micromanage the items on the left more.


## Principles behind the Fragile Manifesto

We follow these principles:

Our highest priority is to surprise the customer with software that matured gracyfully in our advanced processes with a big bang release.

Introduce changing requirements, even without asking the customer. Fragile processes harness change to fix the unreasonable requirements of the customer.

<!--Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

Business people and developers must work 
together daily throughout the project.

Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need, 
and trust them to get the job done.

The most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a development 
team is face-to-face conversation.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Continuous attention to technical excellence 
and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
of work not done--is essential.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
emerge from self-organizing teams.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly.-->
